### Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive MySQL project focusing on analyzing global layoffs data. The aim was to clean and structure a significant dataset for insightful exploratory analysis, uncovering trends related to layoffs across various industries and geographical locations. The project demonstrates the application of advanced SQL techniques for data manipulation and provides actionable insights into economic and workforce trends.

### Technologies Used
- MySQL: For database management and all data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis tasks.
- Table Data Import Wizard: Utilized for importing datasets into the MySQL environment.

### Data Cleaning Process
The initial phase involved preparing the data for analysis by:

- Identifying and removing duplicate records using window functions.
- Standardizing inconsistent data entries and converting data types, such as transforming text-formatted dates into MySQL DATE format.
- Filling missing values through a strategic approach using self-joins to ensure consistency and completeness across the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis
-
- ### Following data cleaning, detailed exploratory analysis was conducted to:

- Identify trends in layoffs over time, with a focus on peak periods and the impact of economic events like the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Analyze layoffs by industry and region to determine which sectors and locations were most affected.
- Utilize SQL window functions to calculate rolling totals, providing a dynamic view of layoffs progression over the analyzed period.
### Insights
The analysis revealed significant trends in layoffs, particularly highlighting industries and regions with the highest layoff rates during economic downturns. It also offered a deeper understanding of the workforce dynamics in response to global events, providing valuable insights for businesses and policymakers.


### Conclusion
This project showcases the power of SQL in handling large datasets and extracting meaningful information from complex data. The findings from this project can assist stakeholders in making informed decisions to better prepare for future economic challenges.
